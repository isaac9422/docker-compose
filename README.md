## Working with docker-compose

This example you will have the following small sample app running on Docker using a *MongoDB* database and a *NodeJS* web server in two separate containers:

Now letÂ´s start our ping server

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run --service-ports echo
```
The above commands, will build the container and run the container (exposing the service ports). 

We now should be able to access the app locally at port 8080.

```sh
http://localhost:8080
```

The configuration used to build and run the container can be found in `docker-compose.yml`.

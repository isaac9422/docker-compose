## Working with docker-compose

This example run a small node js server listening on port 3001. In order to work with docker-compose we use a `docker-compose.yml` file. 

Now letÂ´s start our ping server

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run --service-ports echo
```
The above commands, will build the container and run the container (exposing the service ports). 

We now should be able to access the ping server locally at port 3001.

```sh
http://localhost:8080
```

The configuration used to build and run the container can be found in `docker-compose.yml`.
